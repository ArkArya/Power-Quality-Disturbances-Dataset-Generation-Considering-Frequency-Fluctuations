The Power Quality Disturbances are coded and generated according to this following paper: "Integral mathematical model of power quality disturbances" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8378902/

The parameters can be varied to generate different types of disturbances according to the paper. The generated disturbance signals are sampled at 16 kHz and amplitude is taken to be 1.

The fundamental frequency has been varied from 48Hz to 52Hz with a 0.5Hz increment. The fundamental frequency can be varied using different increments by adding more sections inside the codes in the similar manner.
